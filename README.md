# BrandonDHaskell Personal Site
This is my personal site I built from scratch and my first endeavour into public web deployment. I did not use ```create-react-app```. This was quite the learning experience and it really stretched my brain to wrap my head around the components needed to fully deploy a website.

Feel free to explore my site [https://BrandonDHaskell.com](https://BrandonDHaskell.com), and learn a little bit more about me. You can also go through this README to see how I did it.
